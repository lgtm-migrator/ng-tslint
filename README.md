# ng-tslint

Useful TSLint rules extracted from [`angular/components`](https://github.com/angular/components/tree/master/tools/tslint-rules) for Angular libraries.

## Install

```sh
# npm
npm i -D ng-tslint

# yarn
yarn add -D ng-tslint
```

## Rules

<!-- Rules start -->

### classListSignaturesRule

Rule that catches cases where `classList` is used in a way
that won't work in all browsers that we support.

### coercionTypesRule

TSLint rule that verifies that classes declare corresponding `ngAcceptInputType_*`
static fields for inputs that use coercion inside of their setters. Also handles
inherited class members and members that come from an interface.

### memberNamingRule

Lint rule that checks the names of class members against a pattern. Configured per modifier, e.g.

```json
{
  "member-naming": [
    true,
    {
      "private": "^_" // All private properties should start with `_`.
    }
  ]
}
```

### ngOnChangesPropertyAccessRule

Rule that catches cases where a property of a `SimpleChanges` object is accessed directly,
rather than through a literal. Accessing properties of `SimpleChanges` directly can break
when using Closure's property renaming.

### noCrossEntryPointRelativeImportsRule

Rule that enforces that imports or exports with relative paths do not resolve to
source files outside of the current Bazel package. This enforcement is necessary
because relative cross entry-point imports/exports can cause code being inlined
unintentionally and could break module resolution since the folder structure
changes in the Angular Package release output.

### noExposedTodoRule

Rule that walks through all comments inside of the library and adds failures when it
detects TODO's inside of multi-line comments. TODOs need to be placed inside of single-line
comments.

### noImportExportSpacingRule

Rule that ensures that there are no spaces before/after the braces in import and export clauses.

### noPrivateGettersRule

Rule that doesn't allow private getters.

### noUndecoratedBaseClassDiRule

Rule that doesn't allow inheriting a constructor using dependency injection from an
undecorated base class. With Ivy, undecorated base classes cannot use dependency
injection. Classes that inherit the constructor from the base class can specify
an explicit pass-through constructor to make DI work.

### noUndecoratedClassWithAngularFeaturesRule

Rule that doesn't allow undecorated class declarations using Angular features.

### noUnescapedHtmlTagRule

Rule that walks through all comments inside of the library and adds failures when it
detects unescaped HTML tags inside of multi-line comments.

### preferConstEnumRule

Rule that enforces that we use `const enum` rather than a plain `enum`.

### requireBreakingChangeVersionRule

Rule that ensures that comments, indicating a deprecation
or a breaking change, have a valid version.

### requireLicenseBannerRule

Rule that walks through all TypeScript files of public packages and shows failures if a
file does not have the license banner at the top of the file.

### settersAfterGettersRule

Rule that enforces that property setters are declared after getters.

### validateDecoratorsRule

Rule that enforces certain decorator properties to be defined and to match a pattern.
Properties can be forbidden by prefixing their name with a `!`. Supports whitelisting
files via the third argument, as well as validating all the arguments by passing in a regex. E.g.

```json
{
  "validate-decorators": [
    true,
    {
      "Component": {
        "argument": 0,
        "properties": {
          "encapsulation": "\\.None$",
          "!styles": ".*"
        }
      },
      "NgModule": {
        "argument": 0,
        "properties": "^(?!\\s*$).+"
      }
    },
    "src/material"
  ]
}
```
